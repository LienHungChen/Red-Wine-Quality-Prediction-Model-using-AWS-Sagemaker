# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Model-using-AWS-Sagemaker
This project leverage AWS SageMaker to Build, Train, Deploy, and Evaluate a Machine learning model using the XGBoost algorithm.

## Datasets
  * **Overview:** This dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
  * **Details:** 6 different classes (quality from 3 to 8), 11 variables (based on physicochemical tests), 1599 different wines.
  * **Task:** Classification

## Notes
- Sign in the ```AWS console```, search ```Amazon SageMaker``` and create ```Notebook instances```.
- Install the libraries listed in ```requirements.txt``` with ```!pip install --disable-pip-version-check -q 'PackageName'``` in Notebook instances created in Amazon SageMaker.  
- Download Red Wine Quality dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).
